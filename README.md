# avocado_price_prediction

The price of an Avocado is a vital factor for farmers, sellers also for customers to maximize their profits and to reduce some cost respectively. The purpose of this study is to predict the price of Avocados with the use of several features. This group project was done during my 3rd year under graduate level under the course of Statistical learning. Multiple techniques such as variable  selection methods, linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic net regression, Decision tree regressor and Random Forest regressor were used to build a model to forecast accurate results. With a bit of further data cleaning, hyper parameter tuning and feature engineering techniques also considering the time factor (creating lag variables, pre whitening, identifying the cross correlation) finally the Random Forest model was chosen as the best model with an error percentage of 12%. 

Used softwares: Google colab, R studio, Spyder

Algorithms and techniques: forward, backward, stepwise selection, pre whitening, Multiple linear regression, Decision tree regressor, Random forest regressor, Ridge, Lasso, Elasticnet regression, RandomizedSearchCV

Languages: Python, R
