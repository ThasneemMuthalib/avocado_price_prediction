# avocado_price_prediction

Avocado is a fruit rich in healthy fat, vitamins, and minerals. They are widely used in the production of avocado toast, juices, and smoothies and, also as a fruit. The price is a vital factor for farmers, sellers also for customers to maximize their profits and to reduce some cost respectively. The purpose of this study is to predict the price of Avocados with the use of several features. Multiple techniques such as variable  selection methods, linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic net regression, Decision tree regressor and Random Forest regressor were used to build a model to forecast accurate results. With a bit of further data cleaning and feature engineering techniques also considering the time factor (creating lag variables, pre whitening, identifying the cross correlation) finally the Random Forest model was chosen as the best model with an error percentage of 12%.
